I just want to create a new project for cosmos demo, because if not, the count of libs in project CSharpDemo will be bigger and bigger. It is not what I want to see. 

And we can get more info(such as cosmos stream path and so on) from the doc: https://microsoftapc-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jianjlv_microsoft_com/_layouts/OneNote.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fjianjlv_microsoft_com%2FDocuments%2FJianjun%20%40%20Microsoft&wd=target%28Work.one%7C08C13A75-D69C-49FE-8D53-8DBF6710CCF0%2FSample%20Code%7CF29C765D-F05A-4516-8F35-08DCE5847D4C%2F%29
